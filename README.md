## The API will provide three main endpoints:

1ยบ- Scale Endpoint: /scale - Takes a musical note as input and returns the corresponding musical scale based on that note.

2ยบ- Chord Endpoint: /chord - Takes a musical note as input and returns the necessary notes to form major and minor chords associated with the input note.

3ยบ- Harmonic Field Endpoint: /harmonic-field - Takes a musical note as input and returns the major and minor harmonic fields corresponding to the input note.

## Additional Features:

Utilizes the Express framework in Node.js.

Developed as part of solidifying musical studies and integrating with backend programming knowledge.

This project represents a fusion of passions, blending musical studies with backend programming skills, providing an enriching experience for music enthusiasts with an interest in technology.
